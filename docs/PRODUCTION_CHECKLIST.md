WHERE 
  (usage_mode = 'student_rental' AND student_price_monthly IS NULL)
  OR (usage_mode = 'tourist_short' AND tourist_price_nightly IS NULL);

WHERE tablename IN ('unified_properties', 'unified_bookings', 'investments')
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### 4. Edge Functions Deployment

```

### 5. Deploy Application

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:

### Immediate Actions
1. **Communication**
   - [ ] Notify team via Slack/Email
   - [ ] Post maintenance notice on site (if needed)
   - [ ] Inform affected users

2. **Assess Impact**
   - [ ] Identify affected features
   - [ ] Count affected users
   - [ ] Determine severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

3. **Quick Fix vs Rollback**
   - **Quick Fix** (< 30 min): Patch and redeploy
   - **Rollback** (> 30 min): Revert to previous version

### Rollback Procedure

#### Frontend Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
# (depends on your hosting platform)
# Example for Vercel:
vercel rollback <PREVIOUS_DEPLOYMENT_URL>

# Or Git revert:
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

#### Database Rollback
```sql
-- Restore from backup
-- ONLY if database changes caused issues

-- 1. Stop all write operations
-- 2. Restore from backup
-- 3. Verify data integrity
-- 4. Re-enable write operations
```

#### Edge Functions Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous version
supabase functions deploy <FUNCTION_NAME> --version <PREVIOUS_VERSION>
```
