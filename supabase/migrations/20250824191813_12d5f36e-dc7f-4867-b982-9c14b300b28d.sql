-- Fix critical security vulnerabilities by removing public access to sensitive data

-- =====================================================
-- FIX PROFILES TABLE SECURITY
-- =====================================================

-- Drop dangerous public access policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public access to profiles" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Roommate preferences are viewable by everyone" ON public.profiles;

-- FIX JUNGLE WALLET SECURITY
-- =====================================================

-- Drop dangerous public access policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public access to jungle wallet" ON public.jungle_wallet;

-- Keep the existing secure policy: "Users can view their own wallet"
-- Add missing policies for wallet operations

-- No DELETE policy for wallets - they should be permanent

-- =====================================================
-- FIX NOTIFICATIONS SECURITY
-- =====================================================

-- Drop dangerous public access policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public access to notifications" ON public.notifications;

-- Keep the existing secure policy: "Users can view their own notifications"
-- Add missing policies for notification operations

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own notifications"
