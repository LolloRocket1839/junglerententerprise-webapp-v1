## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Data Model

```
unified_properties (CENTRAL TABLE)
├── usage_mode: 'student_rental' | 'tourist_short' | 'hybrid'
├── Student Fields: student_price_monthly, deposit_amount, academic_year_*
├── Tourist Fields: tourist_price_nightly, cleaning_fee, minimum_stay_nights
├── Investment Fields: investment_goal, amount_raised, investor_share_percentage
└── Shared Fields: title, description, address, rooms, amenities, images, status

unified_bookings
├── booking_type: 'student_rental' | 'tourist_short'
├── property_id → unified_properties
├── guest_id → guests/profiles
└── check_in, check_out, total_price, status

property_revenue_tracking
├── property_id → unified_properties
├── Revenue: student_revenue, tourist_revenue, total_revenue
├── Expenses: mortgage, taxes, maintenance, etc.
└── Distribution: investor_distribution, jungle_rent_share

investments
├── property_id → unified_properties
├── amount, status, payment_status
└── Stripe payment integration
```

### System Flow

**Student Rental Flow:**
1. User searches `/rent` → queries `usage_mode IN ('student_rental', 'hybrid')`
2. Views property → displays `student_price_monthly`
3. Books property → creates `unified_bookings` with `booking_type: 'student_rental'`

**Tourist Booking Flow:**
1. User searches `/stay` → queries `usage_mode IN ('tourist_short', 'hybrid')`
2. Selects dates → calculates `(nightly_rate × nights) + cleaning_fee`
3. Books property → creates `unified_bookings` with `booking_type: 'tourist_short'`

**Investment Flow:**
1. User views `/invest` → queries properties with `investment_goal > 0`
2. Initiates investment → creates Stripe checkout via Edge Function
3. Payment succeeds → updates `amount_raised` in `unified_properties`
4. Returns distributed → Edge Function calculates and distributes monthly

**Revenue Tracking Flow:**
1. Admin triggers "Calculate Returns"
2. Edge Function `calculate-property-returns` executes
3. Calculates revenue breakdown and expenses
4. Distributes to investors based on `investor_share_percentage`
5. Creates record in `property_revenue_tracking`

## ✨ Final Notes

This migration represents a significant architectural improvement:

**Before:**
- 3 separate tables (hubs, student_properties, tourist_properties)
- Duplicate logic across three systems
- Limited flexibility for hybrid properties
- Manual revenue tracking

**After:**
- 1 unified table with flexible usage modes
- DRY code with shared components
- Hybrid properties maximize revenue
- Automated revenue calculations and distributions

The new system is:
- ✅ **Scalable:** Easy to add new usage modes
- ✅ **Maintainable:** Single source of truth
- ✅ **Flexible:** Properties can serve multiple markets
- ✅ **Secure:** Comprehensive RLS policies
- ✅ **Fast:** Optimized queries with indexes
- ✅ **Monitored:** Analytics and error tracking built-in
